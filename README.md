# Markov Chains Code Examples

## Welcome to the Markov Chains Code Examples repository! 

### This repository contains Python code examples that accompany the posts from the Markov Chains series. The code examples demonstrate various concepts, calculations, and practical applications of Markov Chains.

# Posts

## - [Post 1](https://lnkd.in/dAqDFrgm): Introduction to Markov Chains
## - [Post 2](https://lnkd.in/d_HqiWrJ): Representing and Simulating Markov Chains
## - [Post 3](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/george-iskander-40162828_infoabrinabrmin-infoabrmarkov-infoabrinabrmin-activity-7079683134312583168-JDEc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop): Calculation Methods for Stationary Transition

# Code Examples

## - `Simple_Markov_Chain_Simulation.ipynb`: Python code demonstrating the random walk simulation using a Markov Chain model. It simulation the transition for 10 coming steps.

## - `Calculating_Stationary_Probability.ipynb`: Python code demonstrating the different methods estimating the stationary transition probabilities. 

# Getting Started

## To run the code examples, you will need to have Python and the required dependencies installed. The needed libraries are numpy and scipy

## Once the dependencies are installed, you can open the Jupyter Notebook files and run the code cells to see the results and experiment with different scenarios.
